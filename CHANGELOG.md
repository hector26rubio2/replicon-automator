All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [3.6.5] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed

- Fixed `prepare-playwright-build.js` script to find Playwright binaries in global cache (`~/.cache/ms-playwright` on Linux)
- Script now works correctly in GitHub Actions (ubuntu-latest) environment
- Improved binary detection to check both node_modules and system cache

## [3.6.4] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed `ensure-playwright.js` script that was failing in CI/CD environments
- Script now correctly detects Playwright binaries in global cache (`~/.cache/ms-playwright` on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ms-playwright` on Windows)
- Removed overly strict verification that expected binaries only in `node_modules/playwright/`
- CI/CD pipelines can now complete successfully with proper Playwright binary detection
- Support for both development and CI/CD environments (npm cache vs system cache)

## [3.6.3] - 2026-01-09

### Added

**Playwright Runtime Validation & Build Improvements**

- New runtime check service (`playwright-runtime-check.service.ts`) that validates Playwright availability at app startup
- Added `ensure-playwright.js` script for reliable Playwright installation and binary download
- New `diagnose:playwright` command for troubleshooting Playwright issues
- Comprehensive Playwright Build Guide (docs/PLAYWRIGHT_BUILD_GUIDE.md) for developers
- Runtime detection of missing Playwright with helpful error messages in logs

### Changed

- Updated build workflow: `npm run build` now includes `ensure-playwright` and `copy:playwright` steps
- Modified `postinstall` hook to use `ensure-playwright` for better reliability
- Improved `package.json` scripts organization with separate concerns
- Enhanced `prepare-playwright-build.js` for more robust browser detection

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Playwright binaries now guaranteed to be included in installers and updates
- Fixed issue where updating to a new version would lose Playwright binaries
- Resolved "Playwright not found" errors in fresh installations
- Improved error handling in build scripts with better logging
- Ensured both dev and production paths work correctly for Playwright detection

### Technical Details

- App now validates Playwright at runtime (not just at build time)
- Better path resolution for both development and production environments
- Supports recovery mechanism if Playwright is missing after updates
- Diagnostic tools for developers to verify correct setup
- Backward compatible with existing installations

### Migration Guide

**For Users:**

- No action required on update
- If you experience issues, simply reinstall from the new `.exe`
- Alternatively: `npx playwright install chromium --with-deps`

**For Developers:**

1. After `npm install`, Playwright is automatically available
2. Run `npm run diagnose:playwright` to verify setup
3. Build with `npm run dist:win` (includes all validations)

## [3.6.2] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

**Packaging Architecture Fix (asarUnpack)**

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Switched from `extraResources` to `asarUnpack` for Playwright binaries
- Playwright binaries now extracted from app.asar using electron-builder's asarUnpack
- Removed manual binary copying (copy-playwright-bins.js no longer needed)
- Simplified playwright-config.ts to let Playwright auto-discover binaries
- Fixed electron-updater compatibility (asarUnpack updates properly, extraResources don't)

### Changed

- `package.json`: Removed `playwright-bin` from `files` and `extraResources`, added `asarUnpack`
- `playwright-config.ts`: Simplified to return `undefined` (Playwright auto-discovery)
- CI/CD workflow: Updated verification to check `app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/playwright`
- Build scripts: Removed `npm run copy-playwright-bins` from dist commands

### Technical Details

- Previous approach: Copy binaries to `playwright-bin/` → `extraResources` → `resources/playwright`
- New approach: `asarUnpack` → `resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/playwright`
- Playwright finds binaries automatically via internal path resolution
- **Users must uninstall v3.6.0/v3.6.1 and install v3.6.2** (electron-updater cannot migrate asarUnpack)

## [3.6.1] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

**Critical Packaging Fix** ⚠️ DEPRECATED (did not work)

- Attempted to add `playwright-bin/**/*` to `files` configuration
- Issue persisted: electron-updater cannot update extraResources
- Superseded by v3.6.2 with asarUnpack approach
